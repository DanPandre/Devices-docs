| Surface Hub displays "No bootable device" message after attempting to install the Windows 10 Team 2020 update.                                                                        | During the update process, some Hub v1 devices will go into an unbootable state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Re-image the device [using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool](surface-hub-recovery-tool.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Calendar sync of hybrid device accounts with on-premises mailboxes fails.   | Surface Hub devices default to using Modern Authentication for accounts that exist in Azure AD, even if they have on-premises mailboxes that do not work with this feature. In this scenario, Exchange stops syncing meetings to the device. As a result, the device does not receive or display new meetings.                                                                                                    | After [KB4598291](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4598291) (or a subsequent Windows CU) is installed, the [SurfaceHub CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/surfacehub-csp) has a new ExchangeModernAuthEnabled parameter available to toggle the use of Modern Authentication. This can be set to false via MDM policy or [provisioning package](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/3/F/83FD5089-D14E-42E3-AF7C-6FC36F80D347/ExchangeModernAuthDisabled.ppkg) to prevent the Hub from using Modern Authentication.                                                                                                |
